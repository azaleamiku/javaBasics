# Java Basics

This repository is a collection of fundamental Java programs and concepts, perfect for beginners learning the language. It covers various topics from basic syntax to object-oriented programming principles.

## Current Topics

Here are the topics currently covered in this repository, with example code.

### Variables
* **Var.java**: Demonstrates how to declare and initialize different data types.
* **VarInput.java**: Shows how to take user input and store it in a variable.

### Control Flow
* **CtrlFlowDemo.java**: An example of basic control flow structures.
* **DoWhile.java**: Demonstrates the `do-while` loop.
* **ForEach.java**: Shows how to use the `for-each` loop to iterate through an array.
* **Swtch.java**: An example of a `switch` statement.
* **While.java**: An example of a `while` loop.
* **Brk.java**: Demonstrates how to use the `break` statement.

### Arrays
* **Array.java**: Shows how to declare, initialize, and access elements in an array.
* **ArrayNames.java**: An example using an array of strings.
* **AList.java**: Demonstrates the use of the `ArrayList` class.

### Methods
* **Methods.java**: A simple example of creating and calling methods.
* **MethodCal.java**: Demonstrates a method that performs a calculation.

### Classes and Objects
* **Bicycle.java** and **BicycleDemo.java**: A basic example of a class and how to create an object from it.
* **StudentClass.java** and **StudentMain.java**: Another example of creating a class and an object.
* **BookClass.java** and **BookMain.java**: An example of a `Book` class and its main method.
* **LibraryBook.java** and **LibraryMain.java**: An example of a library system.

## Planned Additions

I plan to add more examples and cover additional topics in the future, including:

* **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.
* **Exception Handling**: Using `try-catch` blocks to handle errors.
* **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: More advanced object-oriented programming concepts.
* **More examples** for existing topics.
